# Computer Animation

This is submition of laboratory exercised for course in Computer Animation on "Fakultet elektrotehnike i računarstva", University of Zagreb, Croatia.
There are 3 laboratory excercises:
1. Moving object on aproximation B-Spline
2. Particle Engine with moving source and included gravitation pull.
3. Game of Darts

# Game of Darts

The third assignment is perticulary interesting because the theme was self-selected and it contains multiple skills learned on related course:
- Approximation of mouse location in the game coordinates
- Detection of offset value based on moving pointer
- Calculation of neccesary coordinates for dart animation
- Animation of dart using Cubic Bezier curve
- Colision detection between dart and dartboard
- Calculation and demonstration of results

Next two images show game interface with a scoring system based on console output.
